# Potato Plant Disease Detection

This project aims to detect diseases in potato plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is designed to classify potato leaves into three categories: early blight, late blight, and healthy. By analyzing images of the leaves, the CNN can identify signs of disease and help farmers take timely action to protect their crops.

## Project Overview

Potato diseases, such as early blight and late blight, can significantly affect crop yield and quality. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to build a robust model that can accurately classify potato leaf images, aiding in the timely identification of plant health issues.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of three types of images of potato leaves, representing the following categories:

- **Early Blight**: Images of potato leaves affected by early blight disease, characterized by dark lesions and yellowing of leaf edges.
- **Late Blight**: Images of potato leaves affected by late blight disease, known for water-soaked lesions and a more rapid spread compared to early blight.
- **Healthy**: Images of healthy potato leaves, showing no signs of disease.

## Features

The project leverages CNNs to classify images into the following categories:

- Early blight
- Late blight
- Healthy

## Modeling

The project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the images from the dataset to predict the health status of potato leaves. The model will be evaluated based on its accuracy and ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Usage

- Load the dataset: Import the images of potato leaves from the specified directory.
- Preprocess the images: Resize and normalize the images to prepare them for training.
- Train the model: Use the training set to train the CNN on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model: Test the model on a separate validation set to assess its performance.
- Make predictions: Use the trained model to classify new images of potato leaves.

## Results

The performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.
